# Tour

Lets begin out tour of Scripta with a few screen shots.

- [Home screen](#home-screen).  This is is where 
you land when you go to [Scripta.io](https://scripta.io),
and it is where you sign in to your account or sign 
up for a new account.

- [Header](#header).  The main buttons for controling the app:

- [Footer](#footer).  More buttons: print to PDF,
export to standard LaTeX, etc.

- Working with documents: [view](#viewing-a-document),
[create](#creating-a-document), and
[edit](#editing-a-document) a document

- [Kinds of documents](#kinds-of-documents)

## Home screen

The home screen of Scripta.io, pictured below,
is where you sign up for a new account or sign in
to an existing account.  Items which are underlined
are links to other resources.

## Header

Most of the buttons and links in the header of Scripta.io
are self-explanatory.  If you hover over a button,
you will see a short explanation of what it does.


![Header, browse mode](https://i.ibb.co/6HvxTRN/image.png)


Reading across the bottom row of the header are
(1) the current markup language (click to change if need be);
(2) the open/close editor button; (3,4,5) the new document
section: **Doc** for a standard document, **Folder**
for a [smart folder](/microlatex-lamdera/folders/),
**Collection** for a [collection of other documents](/microlatex-lamdera/collections/);
(6) the author of the current document; (7) **Share**:
edit the [users who share a document](/microlatex-lamdera/sharing/); (8) **Tags** a list
of document tags; (9) **Chat**: open up a 
[chat channel](/microlatex-lamdera/chat/);
(10) Bug icon: open up the bug reporter chat channel;
(11) Red/green square: indicate status of Scripta.io 
connection.

When the editor is open, you see some additional buttons:
(1) **Public/Private**: toggle between public and 
private mode.  A public document can be seen by anyone,
a private document only by its author or users with
whom the document has been shared.

## Footer

The first three buttons of the footer, reading from
left to write are for exporting documents in one
form or another: (1) **Export**: export to ready-to-process
standard LaTeX; (2) **Raw**: export the body of the
document to standard LaTeX; (3) **PDF**: export to PDF.

Then we have (4) the document status (Read only/Can edit).
Clicking on this button toggles between the two alternatives; 
(5) the most recent system message; (6) **Link**:
if the document is public, display a link to it;
(7) **DocTools**: information and tools for the 
current document.

## Viewing a document

First is the normal "browsing" mode.  In the image
below you see two windows.  On the left is the
document
*Wave Packets and the Dispersion Relation*.  On the
right is the list of current documents.  These documents
were found by typing "wave" in the search box. Three
documents were found.  If you had typed "wave pack"
then just one document, *Wave Packets and the Dispersion Relation*
would have been found.

## Creating a document

To create a document, click on the **Doc** button in
the *New* section of the header and fill out 
the form you see below.  If need be, change the 
markup language.  The title must be at least three
letters long.

## Editing a document

If you want to edit the current document — the one
in the left-hand window – clickn on the *Open Editor*
button.  Looking at the image above, you will find
it in the top left part of the app.  When you
click on that button, you go into editing mode,
and the app will look like what you see in the
image below.

## Kinds of documents

We have just described the basic Scripta document.
There are two other kinds:

- [Collections](/microlatex-lamdera/collections/) — create notebooks with chapters
- [Smart folders](/microlatex-lamdera/folders/) — gather documents that share a common tag
