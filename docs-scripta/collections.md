# Collections


Documents can be grouped together as part of a
*collection*, as illustrated below.  The collection
is *Quantum Mechanics Notes*, as indicated
at the top of the right-hand panel.  The 16 documents
which make up the collections are listed in the right
panel, with the current document,
*Wave Packates and the Disperion Relations*,
which is number two in the list, displayed in the
