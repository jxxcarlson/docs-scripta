# Scripta User Documentation

Scripta.io is a web app for creating 
technical documents and publishing them on the web.
The aim is for an easy-to-use, frictionless workflow.
To this end, documents are compiled directly
to Html.  Consequently they can be viewed as-is on 
a computer, laptop, or smartphone.

To make a new document, just press the **New** 
button in the header, then enter the title.  As you
type text in the editor, the text is rendered in real
time.  See the [tour](/microlatex-lamdera/tour/).

## Markup languages

Scripta documents can be written in any one of three
markup languages:

- MicroLaTeX (like LaTeX)
- XMarkdown (like Markdown, but with LaTeX-style formulas)
- L0 (a markup language with a Lisp-like syntax)

## Publishing

To publish a document, click on the **Private** button
in the editor (see the [tour](/microlatex-lamdera/tour#editing-a-document)).
After you do this, the button will change to
**Public**.  To let colleagues, friends, and students
know about your document, click on the **Link** button
in the footer.  Copy that link and distribute it 
however you like: by email or text message, by 
posting it on a web page, etc.  See XX for more about
publishing a document.


## Export

Scripta documents can be exported to standard LaTeX or
to PDF at the push of a button.  See the footer of the 
app in the [tour](/microlatex-lamdera/tour/) screenshots.
